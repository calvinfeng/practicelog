I also want to learn Eric Clapton's live solo by ear. The original solo is kind of boring because it repeats the same intro licks and phrases."

It seemed to me that I have developed the finger strength and dexterity to perform it at 117 or 118 BPM, but my mind isn't connected to my fingers fluidly. Sometimes the fingers listened and other times they didn't. The end results were that I had inconsistent result throughout the recordings in November. On other hand, I am making good progress on November Rain. I will start uploading November Rain recordings in December."

I probably will spend another month to get to 117 BPM. In the meantime, I started working on November Rain's guitar solo. It is an easy solo but the challenge is to get the notes ringing clean and bend with pitch perfection."

I always thought this is the example of shredding. However, now I look at it. I think it's more of an introduction to shredding. It is a great opportunity to introduce myself to sweep picking. The Final Countdown solo has a mini sweep pick across 2 strings. This is not going to be easy but I am dead set on this goal."

I also just recently bought a new American made Fender Stratocaster. I am adapting my fingers around the neck. In terms of speed, Stratocaster neck is noticeably faster than Les Paul neck due to the longer scale length."

In my relax time, I played a bit of Beyond's solo. It helped me to stay sane."

The chord voicing wasn't difficult but it required me to palm mute on all the power chords. The riff that involves moving my left hand quickly also took some efforts to pick up. In my spare time, I picked up Beatles' Yesterday because it's a simple yet beautiful tune."

Wonderful Tonight has a beautiful lick that gives me an early glimpse into string bending technique. Now & Forever is technically challenging to me on acoustic because all I ever learned was strumming basic chords."
